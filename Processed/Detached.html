[CORRUPTED] "—and so we maintain the exobotany work, but there will be no further communication between that First Light team and the K1 project. Furthermore, communication of this sort ends. I'll come and deliver progress reports in person."

"I don't think I need to tell you this, but this is highly unusual, Commander Kuang. Surely our normal security protocols are sufficient."

"I can't tell you what Clovis Bray did when they assisted in setting up this mission. But, I can tell you what I would have recommended to the board if Clovis Bray had been in the position of asking us for help putting a project together."

"I see… But you still haven't explained—" [CORRUPTED]

"I have no doubt. If that's all, I'll take my leave. I have a lot of work to do before tomorrow."

"Certainly. Goodbye, Commander."

"Goodbye, President, Generals, esteemed members of the board. Signing out."
