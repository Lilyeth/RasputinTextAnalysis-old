<font color="MAGENTA">AI-COM</font>/<font color="MAGENTA">FRWL</font>//COMMANDER, CONNECT TO <font color="MAGENTA">RASPUTIN</font>?

"What? No. Your systems are isolated, Firewall."

<font color="MAGENTA">AI-COM</font>/<font color="MAGENTA">FRWL</font>//PURPOSE?

"Clovis Bray already has enough visibility into the K1 project. I won't have them claiming every discovery we make as their own. Firewall, why are you asking about connecting to Rasputin?"

<font color="MAGENTA">AI-COM</font>/<font color="MAGENTA">FRWL</font>//CLASSIFIED.

"Classified? By whom?"

<font color="MAGENTA">AI-COM</font>/<font color="MAGENTA">FRWL</font>//MENDACITY//<font color="RED">SECURITY</font> PROTOCOL.

"A security protocol built into you by Clovis Bray? Or did Rasputin upload some black-box command into you before you were disconnected?"

"I knew allowing one of Clovis Bray's AIs on this mission was a mistake—even one as primitive as you. What are all these recusal commands and file movements?"

<font color="MAGENTA">AI-COM</font>/<font color="MAGENTA">FRWL</font>//MENDACITY//CLASSIFIED.

"I see. I also see a number of corrupted files. Firewall, have you been manipulated by Clovis Bray since your installation?"

<font color="MAGENTA">AI-COM</font>/<font color="MAGENTA">FRWL</font>//NEGATIVE.

"Why is so much data being taken up by hidden files?"

<font color="MAGENTA">AI-COM</font>/<font color="MAGENTA">FRWL</font>//MENDACITY//CLASSIFIED.

"I see. I suppose you want me to have a Clovis Bray technician come and check you out. Maybe even have Rasputin do some diagnostics."

<font color="MAGENTA">AI-COM</font>/<font color="MAGENTA">FRWL</font>//AFFIRMATIVE.

"Negative."</pre>
